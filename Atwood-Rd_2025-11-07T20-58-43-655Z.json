  "full_text": "[matt]: I think people when I. Yeah, a.\n[katie]: Lot of your friends.\n[matt]: I get a lot of people, though.\n[matt]: Yeah.\n[matt]: Anyone who will listen.\n[matt]: Yeah.\n[katie]: When you talk to someone who you feel like is resisting cast iron, what do you say about.\n[matt]: Thanks for that question, caller number one.\n[matt]: Usually, usually you have been six months.\n[matt]: Usually when someone asks me about cast iron or I'm excited to tell them about it, the first things are always, is it hard to clean?\n[matt]: And I think that's always the question because of the fear mongering or the misinformation about soap.\n[matt]: I'd say once you open up the soap thing, a person that thinks it's weird to not use soap to clean something is opened up into the possibility.\n[matt]: And then if you also show someone, you know, how the experience goes with the pan, or if you can show someone how easy it is to just wipe it out after you use it, in some cases it is not.\n[matt]: You would put stainless steel in the dishwasher even.\n[matt]: You might just wash it and have to scrub the pieces that got stuck to it.\n[matt]: But with this cast iron, you could have a chain mail.\n[matt]: You can easily clean it and you can use soap.\n[matt]: So I think that gets people over that part of the equation because that seems to be the most confusing.\n[matt]: Only because of seasoning and like, what if I ruin it and it's not nonstick anymore?\n[matt]: And I think those are a lot of what happens.\n[matt]: And so when I show people how easy it is, I've even timed it before the cleanup from making eggs.\n[matt]: I swear, 2 minutes and 20 seconds, re oiled and ready, back on the stove to cook again.\n[matt]: It's way different than even the.\n[matt]: The nuance of cleaning your stainless steel.\n[null]: It's weird.\n[matt]: So I think that.\n[matt]: And then when people see the options of cast iron, sometimes they see options in certain stores that are cheaper.\n[null]: Is this okay?\n[matt]: Or whatever you can use that are cheaper.\n[matt]: So sometimes when people are looking for cast iron, they look for options that are cheaper.\n[matt]: And they wonder what you get out of this experience of putting a little more of your paycheck now, but putting.\n[matt]: Buying something that costs a little bit more.\n[matt]: Yeah.\n[matt]: In this economy.\n[matt]: Thanks, Joe.\n[matt]: But the.\n[matt]: Okay, clean.\n[matt]: Take 17.\n[matt]: You got it.\n[matt]: So a lot of people, when I.\n[matt]: When they tell me they're looking for cast iron, they'll find cheaper options and that they're curious of, like they're sorry talk.\n[null]: It's hard when you try to do it again.\n[matt]: And I swore.\n[null]: And so this can't be on a Christian tv.\n[matt]: Okay.\n[matt]: Ooh, me, me, me, me, me.\n[matt]: Okay.\n[matt]: Usually when People bring up cast iron.\n[matt]: They tell me that they found a skillet that's cheaper, and they wonder what the difference in the price would be.\n[matt]: And until they really touch it and feel it and feel the weight or the smoothness of the bottom, they don't really understand in the handle and the way it feels in your hand, they don't really understand the difference in cooking on a surface that's maybe more rough.\n[matt]: And so you might try to accommodate that by using more oil or butter to make it nonstick.\n[matt]: And it is harder to use.\n[matt]: And I think when you find this, like, really nice weight, this handle and the smooth bottom, and then.\n[katie]: Sorry, you could call it a smooth surface.\n[matt]: Smooth bottom.\n[matt]: Take 25.\n[katie]: I feel like the bottom is the half the underneath.\n[matt]: Listen, everybody, I think I should just do live shopping right now and whatnot and just keep practicing.\n[matt]: No, but I think the whatnot thing is, like, no one I know would.\n[null]: Ever find me, so I could practice there.\n[null]: It's true.\n[matt]: I could just be called skillet guy.\n[matt]: Skillet bottom.\n[matt]: Soft boy.\n[matt]: Bottom boy.\n[matt]: Okay, take seven.\n[matt]: There's something about.\n[matt]: You have to touch.\n[matt]: You got to see it to believe it, and you don't take my word for it.\n[katie]: So you keep these in your car so you can.\n[matt]: I have.\n[matt]: Well, that is literally what I was doing for that week.\n[matt]: I had him in my car.\n[matt]: Yeah.\n[matt]: That's what Tommy Boyd did with brake.\n[null]: Pads, and it worked.\n[null]: That's.\n[null]: Yeah, it's a reference to Chris Farley, David Spade.\n[matt]: Boy, it's a great movie.\n[matt]: You should watch it because it'll make.\n[null]: You want to go door to door with your skillets.\n[matt]: Okay.\n[null]: The ragtag group.\n[null]: Smooth buttery bottoms.\n[matt]: It's when the smooth surface comes into play and you centrally rub it with your friend to show them how smooth that bottom really is.\n[matt]: Take seven.\n[matt]: Okay, ready?\n[matt]: It is something about that, though.\n[matt]: What do we.\n[matt]: How do we tease out?\n[null]: Like, you.\n[matt]: Once you interact with this skillet, you're like.\n[null]: This is like.\n[matt]: Like seeing.\n[matt]: Once you hold it, once you feel it, like, if those.\n[matt]: The way you have that set up in that room, it's like, literally, you could just hang it on the wall if that's all you want to do with it.\n[matt]: It is a beautiful object.\n[matt]: And I think when you're holding the less expensive ones, you can really tell the difference, and you can tell that it is heavier, it's harder to use, and maybe there's a sense of pride in the beauty of the object and then what you made that object into by the seasoning or the imperfections.\n[matt]: And I think that's why cast iron seems more meaningful and why once you start using it, you want to buy more or use it for everything.\n[matt]: I've never cried so much in my life.\n[katie]: Okay, can you talk about how cast.\n[null]: Iron is our intentional cast iron is.\n[matt]: Kind of a gateway drug to the more intentional.\n[matt]: No, I know it is, though.\n[matt]: I do think I.\n[matt]: Hold on.\n[matt]: Let me tease it out of my little lizard brain.\n[matt]: How do I say it?\n[katie]: Cast iron is his claw.\n[katie]: It's a gateway.\n[katie]: No, that's my line.\n[katie]: That it's a gateway to a more intentional way of looking.\n[matt]: Cast iron is.\n[katie]: Can say it in your words, though.\n[matt]: So a life worth living.\n[matt]: Seriously though, this is when we add.\n[katie]: The number 1, 800.\n[matt]: Yeah, like, yeah, I know.\n[matt]: Like, please call a friend if you need them.\n[matt]: What's yours, though?\n[matt]: I think cast iron is really great.\n[matt]: We should do one where we just splice in, like different things where I'm like, it's really great.\n[matt]: Easy to cook with and it's just the same.\n[matt]: Okay, we should do this in the sauna.\n[matt]: Tell me what to say.\n[katie]: It's cast iron.\n[katie]: Do you feel like cast iron change your life?\n[matt]: I have so many times, but I'm like, cast iron has changed my life.\n[matt]: I'm a better dad.\n[matt]: I run faster.\n[matt]: No, I probably do.\n[matt]: I do make my fried egg though, before, like when I'm cast iron.\n[matt]: Well, if you want to feed into what you're saying, give me a prompt again and I'll like your.\n[matt]: Your statement of gateway to.\n[katie]: Talk to your impression of cast iron.\n[matt]: And translate that for me.\n[matt]: Just meaning like.\n[matt]: Yeah, well, I like the sentiment.\n[matt]: I just meant like your.\n[matt]: I like the own less.\n[matt]: I like.\n[matt]: I like the field ownless.\n[null]: What was it?\n[matt]: I like the field own less.\n[matt]: Love it more because it makes it so.\n[matt]: I think because I wanted to figure out how to cook with cast iron because it felt like it was worth it.\n[matt]: The knowledge that you might pass it down from generation to generation.\n[matt]: You might bring it to a friend's house to do something with it and cook a meal that they couldn't cook before.\n[matt]: I think it shows you that investing in it really makes it worth it.\n[matt]: Not just because it's non toxic, not because it's non stick.\n[matt]: But even if you bought all those, you know, in another type of pan with a coating, I don't think you'd be bringing it on adventures, bringing it to your friend's house.\n[matt]: There's something really meaningful that it's an heirloom and it'll be with you forever.\n[matt]: And I think that kind of starts to make you think about not consuming as much and buying things very intentionally that you think will also have that type of journey in your life.\n[matt]: And I'm gonna cry right now.\n[katie]: Okay, tell me about how your cooking.\n[null]: Journey.\n[katie]: Started and then evolved.\n[null]: Okay.\n[katie]: Without then like, what eggs start to get adventurous.\n[matt]: And then I think the start of cooking with cast iron was always scrambled eggs.\n[matt]: It seems like that seems to be the test of what non stick means to someone because you're using some type of coated pan and that makes frying an egg or doing all these activities that you do in the morning that makes it really easy.\n[matt]: And I think once you figure out that you can get a nonstick surface from cast iron, then you're not, you know, worried.\n[matt]: But I think the biggest test is, like, what is going to stick to a pan.\n[matt]: And you always start with eggs and scrambled eggs.\n[matt]: And I remember just, you know, trusting the process where you heat it up and you wait two minutes or so and then you put a little bit of oil or butter.\n[matt]: I prefer butter.\n[matt]: And you just start moving those eggs around and it's pretty much nonstick from day one.\n[matt]: If it's been season in the way the field ones are.\n[matt]: I had to say that part anyway.\n[matt]: Keep going.\n[null]: Ready?\n[matt]: Yeah.\n[matt]: So you start with scrambled eggs.\n[matt]: That's the gateway to cast iron.\n[matt]: Because once you realize, like, these aren't sticking, then you just start using everything and frying an egg.\n[matt]: I think it took me a trial of one time because you.\n[matt]: Your assumption of, you know how challenging it'll be, you do the same process you did with the scrambled eggs.\n[matt]: You fry an egg and you've never go back.\n[matt]: And it's just the.\n[matt]: You wonder how you ever did any of this.\n[matt]: Even with Teflon, I wasn't enjoying or making fried eggs.\n[matt]: I make a fried egg almost every day now.\n[matt]: And with the smaller field skillets, you can literally crack an egg or two in some of them, and it keeps a perfect shape of a fried egg and you're done.\n[matt]: And you can't make any errors because it's perfect.\n[matt]: So I think those gateways led me to cast iron chicken in the oven.\n[matt]: It led me to sauteing mushrooms and vegetables.\n[matt]: And I.\n[matt]: The flavor you get out of it and cooking burgers and not having all the flavor go into the barbecue grill and retaining it all.\n[matt]: That's malards, you know, Mike.\n[matt]: But yeah, you.\n[matt]: You really sorry.\n[matt]: Whoever has to figure out if there's anything good in this and edit it with transcription Using Descript or other platforms.\n[matt]: Headliner Fireflies is fine too.\n[matt]: I joined a meeting the other day and there were three note takers that had joined the call.\n[katie]: My note.\n[katie]: I use granola.\n[matt]: I do too, and it's a secret.\n[matt]: It was a call with Seth, the financial advisor, and I was like, oh, cool.\n[matt]: Seth, yours is here, Olivia's here, and mine is here.\n[katie]: You guys could just all leave.\n[katie]: Let's just let them talk.\n[matt]: Well, it's weird, but also, you know.\n[null]: The goof where if the person hasn't joined yet and their note taker joined.\n[matt]: You just say the weirdest stuff.\n[katie]: We're AI agents for something else.\n[matt]: Yeah, it's the Matrix.\n[matt]: Haven't you seen the movie Keanu?\n[null]: Yeah.\n[katie]: Or do you think, like, we have one?\n[matt]: Like, my owner is like one owner has.\n[matt]: Like, my owner is Ernest from Ernest Saves Christmas.\n[null]: Rest in peace.\n[matt]: He's my.\n[matt]: But.\n[matt]: Yeah, I do.\n[matt]: But do you.\n[matt]: But will you promise me that if you have a note taker join before the person, you will say something weird so when they look back, they witnessed what you said.\n[matt]: Because it's very funny.\n[matt]: It happens a lot.\n[matt]: Because if they're late, it already joined on time.\n[matt]: Which I think is so dumb.\n[matt]: I don't either.\n[matt]: We use granola, which is.\n[matt]: I was about to say hipaa.\n[matt]: Hipaa not compliant.\n[matt]: Yeah, but all this is real.\n[matt]: I know.\n[matt]: Trust me.\n[matt]: I actually don't do those.\n[matt]: But I did start a gratitude journal with my robot.\n[matt]: Not like a official one, but I'm like, remind me that I said this.\n[null]: Once in the darkness.\n[matt]: Okay, cool.\n[matt]: Do you think there's anything yet?\n[matt]: Yeah, like two things.\n[matt]: No.\n[katie]: There's so much good stuff.\n[matt]: And maybe we find the good stuff and we try to recreate it, but there's like something like I picture the.\n[null]: Commercial that we're not making because of the budget.\n[matt]: But like, I picture this stuff.\n[matt]: I picture I still have these like.\n[null]: Cuts which would take forever of like the pan making different things and like moving throughout.\n[null]: Yeah, but like.\n[null]: And we could pull that off, but it would take styling.\n[null]: Or you're just like, who cares what it looks like?\n[matt]: There is something about we are selling.\n[null]: A perfection out of the box.\n[null]: And it's like, maybe it's cooler to be like, it's nasty.\n[matt]: I don't know how you do that.\n[null]: It's weird, isn't it?\n[katie]: Yeah.\n[null]: Cuz day two, it's nasty.\n[matt]: Well, I just mean my mom thought.\n[null]: It was like, everyone tell me about your mom.\n[null]: Your mom, she loves too say that joke.\n[matt]: My mom.\n[matt]: I got my mom into cast iron She's 74.\n[matt]: Maybe she doesn't want me to tell anyone that my mom is older than.\n[null]: Me.\n[matt]: My mom is older than me by 30 years.\n[matt]: Do the math.\n[matt]: 1982 and no.\n[null]: No I'm eight.\n[null]: I'm 43.\n[matt]: We're all field company is all 43.\n[matt]: I'm 82.\n[matt]: June.\n[katie]: I'm 83.\n[matt]: That's right.\n[katie]: Dan's 82.\n[matt]: Yes.\n[katie]: Chris is 81.\n[matt]: Yes.\n[matt]: Our median our our.\n[null]: Also there has.\n[matt]: Never been a company where everyone's the.\n[katie]: Same age and then Annika screws up.\n[null]: Our are you recording still?\n[katie]: Yeah.\n[katie]: I didn't even type transcript it's actually easier.\n[katie]: Yeah I don't want to deal with.\n[null]: Multiple yeah I see what you need some fisherman's friends for my ro work Fisherman's it's just like a lon that means a shoes suck on before where they sing it's like old school menthol I don't know why that's the one that everyone chooses and they do vocal warm ups I went to Bearsville theater last night.\n[null]: It was nice.\n[null]: Never been in my life.\n[matt]: Went to good night.\n[null]: I still think Sylvia and good night.\n[null]: I do too but it's almost like you just stick to the app and you're golden because sometimes the entrees I've.\n[katie]: Done it at good night.\n[null]: I've done all the the dumplings and yeah also whenever restaurants bring out a cast iron thing like I just wish they're always there.\n[matt]: I know.\n[null]: I remember that there's a thread about it.\n[null]: Okay.\n[matt]: What else do you want to know?\n[null]: My mom.\n[matt]: You want to know about my mom?\n[matt]: My mom.\n[matt]: I'm trying to think of how I say it so well.\n[matt]: I gifted my mom a number.\n[null]: What would we have done or four.\n[null]: Four is the smallest.\n[matt]: I gifted my mom a number four field skillet for her birthday which is not true.\n[null]: I just gifted it to her so.\n[matt]: I don't have to say for her birthday.\n[matt]: But it was funny that I was lying to all of us do that often.\n[matt]: I gave my mom a number four skillet as a gift and she also isn't comfortable in the kitchen and I think by me doing was exciting to use what I think helped me in the kitchen to give to my mom and get her in that rhythm of maybe even just frying an egg every morning or making her life easier.\n[matt]: And I think she went through the same type of experience where you might think it's way harder than it is and I think by telling her you can't do it wrong and as Long as you follow the preheat step in the oil step.\n[matt]: Like, cooking with cast iron is very easy.\n[matt]: And I do remember her first impression of after she cooked, wondering if she did it wrong.\n[matt]: Like, the same fears that I had, which this is now just a therapy session because my mom made me.\n[matt]: But like that overthinking of something that I don't know if we're used to, like, well, don't heat up Teflon too much or don't scratch.\n[matt]: Like you're just worried that you're going to harm something that seems so precious.\n[matt]: But it's literally cast iron, which is not precious.\n[matt]: And so I think my excitement and my new knowledge, I pass it on to my mom and she's now comfortable using it and likes using it to fry eggs.\n[katie]: Tell me about how she.\n[null]: You're like, what wor that it looked?\n[matt]: Yeah.\n[matt]: I think a lot of people that get into cast iron, I even remember early days of mine, once you cook with it, the oils and the seasoning do what it wants to do and it might look splotchy and it doesn't look like when you pulled it out of the box, but there's nothing wrong with it.\n[matt]: It's just a unknown or an incorrect misconception.\n[matt]: But I also if you clean it really good or simply and then you re oil it every time, which I did in the earlier days, I think that you can keep it pretty consistent.\n[matt]: Like it almost looked new most of the time.\n[matt]: And you quickly realize that it doesn't really matter.\n[matt]: And there's all different styles of how the seasoning, you know, interacts with the pan depending on what you cook.\n[matt]: And just because there's like some swirly or splotchy, it is probably still very smooth.\n[matt]: And if you do have a buildup of seasoning anywhere and it feels like there's like a chip or it's uneven, you can easily fix it by contacting Jody at supportfieldcompany, who I've.\n[matt]: I've done that many times.\n[null]: Help.\n[null]: Whatever.\n[matt]: Jody sos@fieldcompany.com how do you fix it?\n[null]: I don't know.\n[matt]: Oh, that was your question.\n[matt]: Yeah, but like.\n[matt]: Yeah.\n[katie]: Anyway, especially on your.\n[katie]: Some of your.\n[katie]: Talk to me about how the season.\n[katie]: It's perfect, it's gotten darker or more.\n[null]: Do you think so tell me how the evolution goes.\n[null]: It just stayed really good.\n[matt]: Like I'm good at it.\n[matt]: Is that okay to be proud of myself?\n[matt]: No, but.\n[matt]: No, but I don't like, I haven't.\n[matt]: When I started with cast iron, I think I really?\n[matt]: Even though it was a little, I think, think I was probably too precious at the beginning with my journey, I realized that you didn't need to be so precious.\n[matt]: Every time I cooked the seasoning and all those changes happen naturally, I was really oiling it and making sure I did that ritual that took about two minutes every time I cooked with it, where I would clean it out, use chain mail on the bottom, and then dry it, put on the stove that was already hot, and then.\n[matt]: Then I would just put the field seasoning oil in it instantly.\n[matt]: And that kind of kept the seasoning very even.\n[matt]: And it was always the same.\n[matt]: And so I think when I started doing different types of things, like cast iron chicken, that gets real oily, and, like, once you wipe that out, you can start to tell that you're building, like, a really nice, even layer from that.\n[null]: And I'm half making some of that up.\n[katie]: But how about the color?\n[katie]: Tell me how the color.\n[matt]: It's brown with a little bit of red and blue.\n[matt]: The color has changed.\n[matt]: How has it?\n[matt]: Do you want me to say it's gotten darker?\n[matt]: I think the interviewer is trying to get the interview.\n[katie]: Is it getting better?\n[matt]: Well, just like me, it's getting better with age.\n[matt]: And, yeah, I think by cooking with it, it gets a lot darker.\n[katie]: I can't coach you on something you're not well.\n[null]: I mean, I'm like, yeah.\n[matt]: Yeah.\n[matt]: As I've cooked, it's gotten, like, when people have to crack their neck before they start talking.\n[matt]: I think by cooking with it, I've noticed that the seasoning has gotten a lot darker.\n[matt]: And what else does it do?\n[katie]: Okay, so you're building seasoning.\n[null]: Yeah.\n[null]: Every day.\n[katie]: Yeah.\n[katie]: So the more layers.\n[matt]: Yeah.\n[matt]: The more the pan darker.\n[katie]: You don't just feel that part, but, like, ideally, you should be getting more nonstick.\n[katie]: And it gets darker and turns.\n[matt]: Yeah, it's like.\n[katie]: It was great.\n[matt]: It's like a slip and slide now.\n[matt]: It's like, barely.\n[matt]: I think the more you cook with it, I've noticed that the seasoning gets darker and it's building more and more layers, and it's getting even more nonstick, which makes it almost foolproof that you can cook with it easily.\n[matt]: Every time.\n[null]: It's so hard trying to.\n[katie]: I can talk to me a little bit about, like, the most adventurous things in.\n[matt]: Oh, one time I was free Soling El Capitan.\n[null]: It's so hard.\n[matt]: There's also the name of an operating.\n[null]: System, so I brought it back to Nerd.\n[matt]: What were you asking?\n[katie]: My husband said to Me the other.\n[null]: Day, look at my computer.\n[matt]: And he was like, why are you on the background?\n[katie]: He's like, what's that background?\n[katie]: And.\n[katie]: And it's Sequoia.\n[katie]: And I was like, oh, that's the default os.\n[katie]: And he's like, oh, is that the new one?\n[katie]: And I was like, no, actually, I haven't updated to the new one yet.\n[matt]: I have.\n[katie]: And.\n[katie]: And then I said, why?\n[katie]: What does yours look like?\n[katie]: And I was like, which one are you on?\n[katie]: And he's like, I don't even know.\n[katie]: He's like, I think so.\n[null]: I wish I wasn't so into this.\n[null]: And always I'm waiting Till it turns 1pm yes, everything gets updated because I'm.\n[matt]: Not using CAD software or engineering.\n[katie]: I usually do it.\n[matt]: Well, in the old.\n[matt]: Yeah, but in the old days, like.\n[null]: Your development setup might not have worked.\n[matt]: You know, because it wasn't compatible.\n[matt]: So, like, we were program.\n[matt]: And then in corporate America, they make.\n[null]: You wait in case there's bugs and blah, blah, blah.\n[matt]: I had to wait 30 days, kind of.\n[matt]: Or just like, software not working.\n[katie]: Tell me about your adventurous cooking.\n[katie]: Like, what was the.\n[katie]: What are some of the things that you did that you were like, wouldn't have done before?\n[katie]: Or, like, why'd you do them?\n[katie]: How did you feel?\n[matt]: So you don't mean free selling.\n[matt]: You mean, like, when I'm cooking?\n[katie]: Yeah.\n[katie]: And then are there things that you're like, you haven't done yet that you're like, oh, these are some things I've wanted to try.\n[katie]: Or you can also just say, no.\n[null]: I don't want that.\n[matt]: I played the fifth on that.\n[matt]: I think I've tried everything.\n[null]: I.\n[matt]: It didn't hurt, but I couldn't.\n[matt]: I couldn't.\n[matt]: Or, like, put on their lip and then bleed.\n[matt]: I'm just making sure.\n[matt]: Clear your calendar.\n[matt]: We're doing audio.\n[matt]: My.\n[matt]: Please can I come out of this sauna wearing a robe with a steamy pan?\n[null]: Yeah.\n[null]: Isn't it funny that I accidentally made a spa in my backyard, but it was never the intention.\n[matt]: Like, those were all different moments.\n[matt]: It's really nice, though.\n[matt]: And I angle.\n[matt]: I angled it.\n[null]: You perfect in that, like, get rid of the kids thing.\n[matt]: Long story short, I angled it like.\n[null]: That because when you look at that back window, like, you don't know where you are, and it's really nice.\n[matt]: And so I tried to angle it.\n[null]: And I ran the electricity with my electrician.\n[null]: It was really hard.\n[null]: That was my 40th birthday gift for.\n[null]: It's rated for four to six.\n[null]: But those two other people would have to be tiny.\n[null]: And I mean non children but tiny people.\n[matt]: Online.\n[null]: Craigslist.\n[matt]: But that.\n[null]: Yeah.\n[matt]: But it's really nice.\n[null]: It's great for two to be comfortable.\n[matt]: Only 38.\n[matt]: It goes to this corner.\n[matt]: That's.\n[null]: Yep.\n[null]: GW or the Department of water that like cops patrol this.\n[null]: Which is less than ideal.\n[matt]: But.\n[matt]: Well, the funny thing is I was in the outdoor shower.\n[null]: Nope.\n[matt]: And I'm going to ask them someday.\n[matt]: I have I on the record.\n[null]: Yes.\n[null]: I have snowshoed back there.\n[matt]: Because it's only like I'm not.\n[matt]: I know.\n[matt]: I'm not doing anything bad.\n[matt]: This is the.\n[null]: Oh.\n[matt]: Sorry.\n[null]: That the mound is the aqueduct that brings water to New York City.\n[null]: Oh.\n[matt]: So the irony of some things is my well ran dry and I had to dig a new well or drill a new well.\n[matt]: And there's literally you could just like tap into New York City's entire water.\n[null]: Supply goes through that too.\n[null]: And I know.\n[matt]: But it's also cool that I'm not using that water and I have my.\n[null]: Own water because yours is touched by a city and mine's pure.\n[katie]: Well, I use a bur.\n[null]: Sure.\n[null]: We'll look that up on mine.\n[katie]: All right.\n[null]: What were we talking about?\n[null]: You put it in the freezer when you go out of town to Maine for two months in the fridge.\n[katie]: Sometimes I take it apart and let.\n[null]: It dry out and then re membrane.\n[katie]: It so it doesn't stick it.\n[null]: Yeah.\n[null]: They kind of got called out for not being as good as they want.\n[null]: Said but I have one under the counter if you want to look at it.\n[null]: But anyway, this.\n[null]: I was about to tell you this on a.\n[null]: It's my 40th birthday.\n[null]: It was a surprise.\n[matt]: All my friends pitched in, some more.\n[null]: Than others or like a group of and then eight days later my child was born.\n[matt]: So I turned 40, got my dream and and then was like, oh my God, I'm never going to be able to eat it.\n[matt]: No.\n[matt]: But it was like, oh my God.\n[matt]: So much is happening at once.\n[matt]: And anyway, so it's really special.\n[matt]: And Russell and his brother were still.\n[null]: Doing my backyard and so this like didn't exist and it was really weird.\n[matt]: And we had a home birth.\n[katie]: So you could have home birthed in the sauna.\n[katie]: You should have just gone in the sauna.\n[matt]: There used to be a deck there.\n[null]: That was falling apart.\n[null]: Yeah.\n[matt]: Okay.\n[null]: What happens next?\n[matt]: So when I is it been recording this whole time?\n[matt]: I just let it go.\n[matt]: Like it look faster.\n[matt]: Okay.\n[matt]: So the adventure.\n[matt]: I feel like the adventure cooking.\n[matt]: I'm asking you a Question almost while I say it, but the adventurous cooking is more of being comfortable with cooking.\n[matt]: The adventure, I guess, is trying to sear the steak that I've never done.\n[matt]: I think you.\n[matt]: You see that example a lot.\n[matt]: And that's like the benefit of cast iron is you.\n[matt]: It gets really hot.\n[matt]: You could sear a steak.\n[matt]: You can do a lot of stuff like that.\n[matt]: I think the adventurous cooking also when you get into cast iron is trusting that you can go from pancakes and then just throw some eggs on it.\n[matt]: And, you know, the same way you'd cook at a diner or a really epic restaurant where they're using a griddle, you realize you can just throw anything on it and it doesn't matter how clean clean it is or if you clean it in between.\n[matt]: And that is another really awesome benefit of using the griddles and cast iron in general is you can make a ton of stuff and you don't have.\n[null]: To be precious about it.\n[katie]: What's the next thing you're gonna.\n[matt]: On the roadmap?\n[matt]: No, but I.\n[katie]: What's your Thanksgiving?\n[matt]: I'll wrote.\n[matt]: I'll eat.\n[matt]: I'll probably roast it.\n[matt]: Chicken in the number 12.\n[matt]: Because that's what I did last year.\n[matt]: I know that's.\n[matt]: Sorry, turkeys, but.\n[matt]: Or actually benefit to you guys.\n[matt]: I'm apologizing the turkeys on the record.\n[matt]: Sorry, chickens, but yeah, like, it tastes better.\n[matt]: But using the number 12 is incredible.\n[matt]: Like, you fill as much in there as you can.\n[matt]: Giant turkey and.\n[matt]: But I had never done that.\n[matt]: And this was literally the reason I tried it for the first time was having a cast iron pan that was big enough to put the whole chicken in and then put in the oven and know that it was going to cook evenly and how to do it and using that method where you do it really, really hot at first, like 500 degrees.\n[null]: And it's awesome.\n[matt]: And it turns out really well.\n[matt]: I love teaching the.\n[matt]: My teachers to fish as well.\n[matt]: So I think, yeah, I look forward to doing bigger.\n[matt]: And also looking for specific cast iron recipes that you can't make in anything else.\n[matt]: Is kind of another awesome journey of cast iron where maybe you're making a type of bread or you're making pizza in it, which you wouldn't have done, you know, in another way.\n[matt]: Or you're making cinnamon roll.\n[matt]: Like all of the benefits of cast iron and baking, I don't think I've got to do yet.\n[matt]: And I'm really excited to start doing that stuff.\n[matt]: And there's a lot of awesome recipes and cookbooks that are so specific to that.\n[matt]: That should have pictures of Field skillet, Lincoln Bio or Lincoln Notes below.\n[matt]: Yeah.\n[matt]: So that is a lot of.\n[null]: Yeah.\n[matt]: Just weird to get a tool that can do so much and to almost get to seek out this whole new world of cooking that you never knew existed.\n[katie]: It's so hard, but it's like you're doing it for.\n[matt]: It is real.\n[matt]: And I'm living that life.\n[matt]: Yes.\n[matt]: But one thing to note.\n[matt]: In a household or when guests come over, there are a few things that you don't want to happen to your cast iron.\n[matt]: Sometimes when a guest comes over, they might put your cast iron in a sink and let it soak, and you look around and you wonder who did it, because what kind of animal?\n[matt]: No, but really, like, there are some funny.\n[matt]: Like, yes, cast iron is amazing.\n[matt]: You can do whatever and you can fix whatever happens.\n[matt]: But there is some preciousness to like you.\n[matt]: You take a pride in cast iron, where you've worked so hard on the seasoning, and you're really proud of it, and it's even and perfect.\n[matt]: And then maybe someone uses it and doesn't know as much as you, or it hasn't been with the skillet as long as you have.\n[matt]: And it's funny how you can get attached to it like no other piece of cookware when someone else uses it because I made it.\n[matt]: My.\n[matt]: It's like my efforts made that pan epic.\n[matt]: So she does the funny part.\n[matt]: It's the cooking.\n[matt]: It's.\n[matt]: Sometimes I yell, I'll clean it, because I have a thing.\n[matt]: Like, I love doing it.\n[matt]: I. Yeah, I really like knowing that I cleaned it properly and reset it and it's ready to go for the next person.\n[matt]: And that doesn't mean it's hard to do or special.\n[matt]: It's just the way I've kept the seasoning perfect.\n[matt]: I know that I'm cleaning it correctly, and so, yeah, y' all don't touch it until I'm back downstairs.\n[matt]: Everybody leave.\n[matt]: But honestly, the last month, probably her brother.\n[matt]: This is off the record.\n[matt]: And our friend that was over the other day took it off the stove and put in the sink to be.\n[null]: Washed for a weird amount of time.\n[matt]: Like, could have been hours.\n[matt]: Everything was fine, but it was.\n[matt]: You just instantly, I'm like, what kind of person would do that?\n[matt]: And it's really funny.\n[katie]: While I'm cleaning the kitchen, this is.\n[matt]: This is like, leave during the day.\n[katie]: And come back while I'm doing some other stuff.\n[katie]: And I just.\n[matt]: You're allowed to do that.\n[matt]: But on my cast iron podcast, we're.\n[null]: Not allowed to do that.\n[matt]: And people that come over and just do that aren't allowed back.\n[katie]: I need.\n[katie]: I need you to do a pickup line of that starts with, like, my wife does.\n[katie]: I kind of like that story.\n[katie]: And I kind of, like, want to use that.\n[katie]: Just leave it.\n[katie]: But I don't have you saying.\n[matt]: My wife does cook with the cast iron pans.\n[matt]: How do I do it?\n[matt]: Ready?\n[matt]: Yeah, my wife cooks with the cast iron pans.\n[matt]: But I sometimes yell, I'll clean it once we're done.\n[matt]: Because I really take pride in making sure I clean it really good.\n[matt]: And.\n[matt]: Yeah, I know.\n[matt]: I just.\n[matt]: I had to.\n[matt]: I can't just, like.\n[matt]: I mean, I know what a drop in is.\n[matt]: I can do, you know, ADR in a studio.\n[matt]: Probably something too.\n[matt]: I don't know.\n[matt]: But ADR is, you know, when you're watching a TV or film and you can tell their lips are out of sync and it's from behind.\n[matt]: It's because someone probably went into a studio and, like, redid the lines and I don't know why it looks so dumb still.\n[katie]: Because you're like, in this economy, I.\n[matt]: Mean, with AI, we're just doing what we can.\n[null]: Yeah.\n[matt]: This is all stuff I really think about.\n[matt]: Cast iron.\n[matt]: Yeah.\n[matt]: It'll be funny when it's like, yes, I did do that.\n[matt]: Like, I just spliced and you can tell it's from another place.\n[matt]: Yeah, keep going.\n[katie]: Okay.\n[katie]: If you were gonna okay someone who's totally new to cast iron in your life, we're gonna get them, like, a really nice gift for business.\n[katie]: So, like, want to get some of the cleaning products, some of the accessories or what?\n[katie]: Like, what is the package?\n[matt]: What's the perfect, like, kit to get started?\n[matt]: It's funny you said starter set, because I remember being on the field website seeing.\n[matt]: I know.\n[matt]: I'm just kidding.\n[matt]: I was kidding.\n[matt]: Reuben recommends also.\n[matt]: I do picture.\n[matt]: We could be sitting outside doing a interview.\n[matt]: Cast iron.\n[katie]: Like, Well, I think maybe we should.\n[matt]: Well, I just mean, like, we can do lots of these.\n[matt]: But I do think it'd be funny if it's just two people literally talking about, like, a cast iron skillet.\n[matt]: Like, it's kind of funny.\n[matt]: Yeah, but it doesn't even have to.\n[null]: Look like a podcast.\n[matt]: It's just like, you're interviewing someone randomly outside.\n[matt]: No, because George will have the.\n[matt]: Okay, what was your question kit starting when I. I think that did it.\n[matt]: Did it get that on the mic?\n[null]: It shouldn't.\n[matt]: That was just my.\n[null]: What is this called?\n[katie]: Mini Turner.\n[matt]: This is just My mini Tina Turner falling onto the ground.\n[matt]: We used to yell I Ike Turner when you were taking a left for some reason in high school.\n[matt]: Because that was her husband's name and.\n[null]: No one really talks about him as much.\n[matt]: But anyway, I don't have these.\n[matt]: You're leaving them here?\n[matt]: Because I'm trying to amass like more than anyone.\n[matt]: I know.\n[matt]: I know.\n[null]: It's okay.\n[matt]: Not now that I've dropped it 10 times.\n[matt]: I think the best.\n[matt]: Okay.\n[matt]: Starter kit.\n[matt]: We've been doing this for two hours.\n[null]: It feels.\n[null]: It could be an hour.\n[matt]: Which also proves that I have the gift of gab.\n[matt]: Yeah.\n[matt]: Me.\n[matt]: I could like dig up some leaves and find one and.\n[matt]: And be like, what's this?\n[matt]: And then just put it on my solo stove.\n[matt]: I mean, literally, we did find a Waylon Jennings 8 track cassette in the remodel.\n[matt]: Like, that was the.\n[matt]: It was in the.\n[matt]: Under the, like, foundation.\n[matt]: When we took it to the studs in that area, one thing was found and it was an eight track.\n[matt]: Isn't that amazing?\n[matt]: And it was a good, like, it's.\n[matt]: If I. Yeah, I think so.\n[matt]: And it's actually.\n[matt]: It would be a.\n[matt]: It's a good find.\n[matt]: I went on ebay to see if it was worth anything.\n[matt]: It's about $12.\n[katie]: $12 more than you had before.\n[matt]: Well, after fees and shipping, it would be.\n[null]: Cogs.\n[matt]: You know, everybody or whatever.\n[matt]: What would I say?\n[matt]: Oh, yeah.\n[matt]: And if you want to excel in E Commerce, just download my PDF@whatever.com.\n[katie]: We could just do like the answer where.\n[katie]: Like E Commerce, but for people that don't care more about living well than about consumption.\n[matt]: I know, but it was really cool.\n[matt]: And I still have it.\n[matt]: If you want to see it after this episode, I'll show it to you.\n[katie]: We could do a whole episode where we just comments that people leave on our ads.\n[matt]: Yeah.\n[katie]: And then how we respond to them.\n[matt]: You had really.\n[matt]: There was.\n[matt]: Why was that one really pissed off.\n[null]: At a company that advertises stuff like they do.\n[katie]: They could just.\n[katie]: They could just scroll on by and they.\n[matt]: I haven't read them.\n[katie]: People that feel like they need.\n[matt]: Yes, there are.\n[matt]: And a lot of bots too.\n[matt]: Like feel that need.\n[matt]: You just go.\n[matt]: And there's no.\n[matt]: I don't.\n[matt]: I don't know.\n[matt]: I know I found it, but.\n[matt]: But you guys had already found it.\n[matt]: Well, I was looking at that shopping cart speed issue that no one cares about except for me.\n[matt]: Well, so I went to abandoned cart and then I'm like, well, I messaged George.\n[matt]: I'm like, are you Testing something to see if the speed is working or is this and he was like oh there's another channel.\n[null]: We're already talking about it.\n[matt]: But anyway it was just funny.\n[matt]: The one moment I looked was getting a DDoS.\n[matt]: But Shopify also.\n[matt]: Do you ever think about how Shopify built on Ruby on Rails and that is like the most non optimized system in the world but it powers all E commerce.\n[katie]: I'm just waiting to see what day during these holidays.\n[matt]: Why do you believe that?\n[matt]: Has it ever?\n[matt]: No.\n[katie]: There's always a moment.\n[katie]: So many people are shopping there holiday.\n[null]: Without a Everybody pan the king.\n[null]: We should do a don't panic.\n[katie]: You do a whole campaign don't panic.\n[matt]: There's still time to buy for the holidays.\n[matt]: Yeah.\n[matt]: We could do a dad joke series.\n[matt]: Is it still going?\n[katie]: Oh yeah.\n[matt]: Okay.\n[matt]: This is good for otter too because.\n[null]: You could be getting transcript at the.\n[matt]: Same time or one of those.\n[katie]: Anyway I do I find Fireflies is really good at speaker recognition.\n[matt]: Are you doing you Fireflies?\n[katie]: No, what I do is I will ba to ba.\n[matt]: Yeah.\n[katie]: Because I found that the Fireflies app is actually very unreliable and doesn't But I'm like voice mem.\n[matt]: Yeah.\n[matt]: Reliable built in iOS.\n[matt]: The starter kit question is that so valid?\n[null]: Yeah.\n[matt]: Or that chip.\n[matt]: I think getting started with cast iron the only tools I needed to keep it clean and to keep it working as good as I wanted it to were I thought having chain mail.\n[matt]: I use scrubbers and I think they're great you using the scrubber and getting the bigger chunks off.\n[matt]: But I have honestly switched to just using chain mail and then I use the seasoning oil and I think those are the only two tools you need.\n[matt]: And if you add soap, you can add the scrubber in there.\n[matt]: But I don't use soap that much.\n[matt]: I'm still alive.\n[matt]: I do have this weird rash.\n[matt]: I just.\n[null]: Sorry.\n[matt]: I. I haven't slept in six months but it's working great.\n[matt]: I got a rash.\n[katie]: Who are you?\n[null]: Who.\n[katie]: What are we gifting?\n[katie]: What are we gifting this year?\n[katie]: It's 2020.\n[matt]: Listen, under that stocking or eight days of Hanukkah.\n[null]: Oh, how many skillets?\n[null]: There's six skillets.\n[matt]: That would have been good though.\n[matt]: A care kit and a tote bag.\n[matt]: Yeah.\n[matt]: But honestly the eight days of Honeycutt and then tell us about Judaism and Hanukkah.\n[katie]: Tell us about the just like list off the things.\n[katie]: Like these are my favorite things.\n[katie]: I probably give them and then like.\n[matt]: What would I buy?\n[matt]: Like if I could buy anything for someone at field.\n[katie]: Yeah.\n[katie]: Like, let's say you get the employee discount and you're like, I'm gonna get the.\n[matt]: Get them gorgeous.\n[null]: And they.\n[katie]: Let's say.\n[katie]: But let's say they live in an apartment.\n[katie]: So you want to get them the essentials, but, like, you don't want to spare.\n[katie]: You don't want money to be the factor.\n[katie]: And then please say at the end, they have these nice sets, these nice grocery.\n[katie]: Nice large canvas totes.\n[katie]: And I would get one.\n[katie]: I would put a bunch.\n[matt]: I use one.\n[katie]: Use it as a gift bag or something.\n[matt]: Yeah, I say something, just maybe say something.\n[matt]: I do use your tote bags the most.\n[matt]: They are my favorite tote bag at this time.\n[null]: Just.\n[matt]: That's a real CSA tributary farm.\n[matt]: And then I use it at.\n[matt]: Sometimes I go to my town market, my local market in Stoneridge and Rosendale.\n[matt]: Not for this commercial, but yes.\n[matt]: Not for this host red, but yes, I go to Emmanuel's and I use it because they no longer provide bags.\n[matt]: Yeah.\n[null]: So we have this go on Thursdays.\n[katie]: We have this, like, play horse.\n[katie]: Like, what do you call them?\n[katie]: Like a stick horse for the kid.\n[matt]: What do you call that?\n[katie]: I don't know, but I got it in Mexico.\n[katie]: I got it in.\n[matt]: I got it actually made in Mexico in San Miguel.\n[matt]: Yeah.\n[katie]: And so we brought it back for Ada.\n[katie]: I was pregnant with Anna.\n[katie]: So I bring it back to her, and she's like.\n[katie]: She asked me what, what, what?\n[katie]: And I was like, oh, I.
