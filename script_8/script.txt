============================================================

Clip 1:
I gifted my mom a number four field skillet for her birthday which is not true. I just gifted it to her.

Clip 2:
I gave my mom a number four skillet as a gift and she also isn't comfortable in the kitchen and I think by me doing was exciting to use what I think helped me in the kitchen to give to my mom and get her in that rhythm of maybe even just frying an egg every morning or making her life easier.

Clip 3:
And I think she went through the same type of experience where you might think it's way harder than it is and I think by telling her you can't do it wrong and as long as you follow the preheat step in the oil step. Like, cooking with cast iron is very easy.

Clip 4:
And I do remember her first impression of after she cooked, wondering if she did it wrong. Like, the same fears that I had.

Clip 5:
And so I think my excitement and my new knowledge, I pass it on to my mom and she's now comfortable using it and likes using it to fry eggs.
