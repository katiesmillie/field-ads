============================================================

Clip 1:
I think that's why cast iron seems more meaningful and why once you start using it, you want to buy more or use it for everything.

Clip 2:
I feel like the adventure cooking. I'm asking you a question almost while I say it, but the adventurous cooking is more of being comfortable with cooking. The adventure, I guess, is trying to sear the steak that I've never done.

Clip 3:
I think the adventurous cooking also when you get into cast iron is trusting that you can go from pancakes and then just throw some eggs on it.

Clip 4:
And, you know, the same way you'd cook at a diner or a really epic restaurant where they're using a griddle, you realize you can just throw anything on it and it doesn't matter how clean clean it is or if you clean it in between.

Clip 5:
And that is another really awesome benefit of using the griddles and cast iron in general is you can make a ton of stuff and you don't have to be precious about it.
