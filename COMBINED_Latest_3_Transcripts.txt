=== TRANSCRIPT ===

[matt]: I think people when I. Yeah, a.
[katie]: Lot of your friends.
[matt]: I get a lot of people, though.
[matt]: Yeah.
[matt]: Anyone who will listen.
[matt]: Yeah.
[katie]: When you talk to someone who you feel like is resisting cast iron, what do you say about.
[matt]: Thanks for that question, caller number one.
[matt]: Usually, usually you have been six months.
[matt]: Usually when someone asks me about cast iron or I'm excited to tell them about it, the first things are always, is it hard to clean?
[matt]: And I think that's always the question because of the fear mongering or the misinformation about soap.
[matt]: I'd say once you open up the soap thing, a person that thinks it's weird to not use soap to clean something is opened up into the possibility.
[matt]: And then if you also show someone, you know, how the experience goes with the pan, or if you can show someone how easy it is to just wipe it out after you use it, in some cases it is not.
[matt]: You would put stainless steel in the dishwasher even.
[matt]: You might just wash it and have to scrub the pieces that got stuck to it.
[matt]: But with this cast iron, you could have a chain mail.
[matt]: You can easily clean it and you can use soap.
[matt]: So I think that gets people over that part of the equation because that seems to be the most confusing.
[matt]: Only because of seasoning and like, what if I ruin it and it's not nonstick anymore?
[matt]: And I think those are a lot of what happens.
[matt]: And so when I show people how easy it is, I've even timed it before the cleanup from making eggs.
[matt]: I swear, 2 minutes and 20 seconds, re oiled and ready, back on the stove to cook again.
[matt]: It's way different than even the.
[matt]: The nuance of cleaning your stainless steel.
[null]: It's weird.
[matt]: So I think that.
[matt]: And then when people see the options of cast iron, sometimes they see options in certain stores that are cheaper.
[null]: Is this okay?
[matt]: Or whatever you can use that are cheaper.
[matt]: So sometimes when people are looking for cast iron, they look for options that are cheaper.
[matt]: And they wonder what you get out of this experience of putting a little more of your paycheck now, but putting.
[matt]: Buying something that costs a little bit more.
[matt]: Yeah.
[matt]: In this economy.
[matt]: Thanks, Joe.
[matt]: But the.
[matt]: Okay, clean.
[matt]: Take 17.
[matt]: You got it.
[matt]: So a lot of people, when I.
[matt]: When they tell me they're looking for cast iron, they'll find cheaper options and that they're curious of, like they're sorry talk.
[null]: It's hard when you try to do it again.
[matt]: And I swore.
[null]: And so this can't be on a Christian tv.
[matt]: Okay.
[matt]: Ooh, me, me, me, me, me.
[matt]: Okay.
[matt]: Usually when People bring up cast iron.
[matt]: They tell me that they found a skillet that's cheaper, and they wonder what the difference in the price would be.
[matt]: And until they really touch it and feel it and feel the weight or the smoothness of the bottom, they don't really understand in the handle and the way it feels in your hand, they don't really understand the difference in cooking on a surface that's maybe more rough.
[matt]: And so you might try to accommodate that by using more oil or butter to make it nonstick.
[matt]: And it is harder to use.
[matt]: And I think when you find this, like, really nice weight, this handle and the smooth bottom, and then.
[katie]: Sorry, you could call it a smooth surface.
[matt]: Smooth bottom.
[matt]: Take 25.
[katie]: I feel like the bottom is the half the underneath.
[matt]: Listen, everybody, I think I should just do live shopping right now and whatnot and just keep practicing.
[matt]: No, but I think the whatnot thing is, like, no one I know would.
[null]: Ever find me, so I could practice there.
[null]: It's true.
[matt]: I could just be called skillet guy.
[matt]: Skillet bottom.
[matt]: Soft boy.
[matt]: Bottom boy.
[matt]: Okay, take seven.
[matt]: There's something about.
[matt]: You have to touch.
[matt]: You got to see it to believe it, and you don't take my word for it.
[katie]: So you keep these in your car so you can.
[matt]: I have.
[matt]: Well, that is literally what I was doing for that week.
[matt]: I had him in my car.
[matt]: Yeah.
[matt]: That's what Tommy Boyd did with brake.
[null]: Pads, and it worked.
[null]: That's.
[null]: Yeah, it's a reference to Chris Farley, David Spade.
[matt]: Boy, it's a great movie.
[matt]: You should watch it because it'll make.
[null]: You want to go door to door with your skillets.
[matt]: Okay.
[null]: The ragtag group.
[null]: Smooth buttery bottoms.
[matt]: It's when the smooth surface comes into play and you centrally rub it with your friend to show them how smooth that bottom really is.
[matt]: Take seven.
[matt]: Okay, ready?
[matt]: It is something about that, though.
[matt]: What do we.
[matt]: How do we tease out?
[null]: Like, you.
[matt]: Once you interact with this skillet, you're like.
[null]: This is like.
[matt]: Like seeing.
[matt]: Once you hold it, once you feel it, like, if those.
[matt]: The way you have that set up in that room, it's like, literally, you could just hang it on the wall if that's all you want to do with it.
[matt]: It is a beautiful object.
[matt]: And I think when you're holding the less expensive ones, you can really tell the difference, and you can tell that it is heavier, it's harder to use, and maybe there's a sense of pride in the beauty of the object and then what you made that object into by the seasoning or the imperfections.
[matt]: And I think that's why cast iron seems more meaningful and why once you start using it, you want to buy more or use it for everything.
[matt]: I've never cried so much in my life.
[katie]: Okay, can you talk about how cast.
[null]: Iron is our intentional cast iron is.
[matt]: Kind of a gateway drug to the more intentional.
[matt]: No, I know it is, though.
[matt]: I do think I.
[matt]: Hold on.
[matt]: Let me tease it out of my little lizard brain.
[matt]: How do I say it?
[katie]: Cast iron is his claw.
[katie]: It's a gateway.
[katie]: No, that's my line.
[katie]: That it's a gateway to a more intentional way of looking.
[matt]: Cast iron is.
[katie]: Can say it in your words, though.
[matt]: So a life worth living.
[matt]: Seriously though, this is when we add.
[katie]: The number 1, 800.
[matt]: Yeah, like, yeah, I know.
[matt]: Like, please call a friend if you need them.
[matt]: What's yours, though?
[matt]: I think cast iron is really great.
[matt]: We should do one where we just splice in, like different things where I'm like, it's really great.
[matt]: Easy to cook with and it's just the same.
[matt]: Okay, we should do this in the sauna.
[matt]: Tell me what to say.
[katie]: It's cast iron.
[katie]: Do you feel like cast iron change your life?
[matt]: I have so many times, but I'm like, cast iron has changed my life.
[matt]: I'm a better dad.
[matt]: I run faster.
[matt]: No, I probably do.
[matt]: I do make my fried egg though, before, like when I'm cast iron.
[matt]: Well, if you want to feed into what you're saying, give me a prompt again and I'll like your.
[matt]: Your statement of gateway to.
[katie]: Talk to your impression of cast iron.
[matt]: And translate that for me.
[matt]: Just meaning like.
[matt]: Yeah, well, I like the sentiment.
[matt]: I just meant like your.
[matt]: I like the own less.
[matt]: I like.
[matt]: I like the field ownless.
[null]: What was it?
[matt]: I like the field own less.
[matt]: Love it more because it makes it so.
[matt]: I think because I wanted to figure out how to cook with cast iron because it felt like it was worth it.
[matt]: The knowledge that you might pass it down from generation to generation.
[matt]: You might bring it to a friend's house to do something with it and cook a meal that they couldn't cook before.
[matt]: I think it shows you that investing in it really makes it worth it.
[matt]: Not just because it's non toxic, not because it's non stick.
[matt]: But even if you bought all those, you know, in another type of pan with a coating, I don't think you'd be bringing it on adventures, bringing it to your friend's house.
[matt]: There's something really meaningful that it's an heirloom and it'll be with you forever.
[matt]: And I think that kind of starts to make you think about not consuming as much and buying things very intentionally that you think will also have that type of journey in your life.
[matt]: And I'm gonna cry right now.

=== TRANSCRIPT ===

[matt]: They were epic Shishitos.
[katie]: Your shishitos were great.
[matt]: Okay, now you can look.
[matt]: You didn't like my shishitos.
[matt]: Test, test, test.
[matt]: You didn't like my shishitos and you were mean.
[matt]: No, I know, but just I want everyone to know that I'm waiting for it.
[katie]: Okay, So a year ago you ate.
[matt]: A year ago my wife was the one who cooked and I would make a few meals.
[matt]: But when I cook, it's meat sauce and spaghetti, which is once a week.
[matt]: We still have that.
[matt]: It's the best.
[matt]: It's one of my favorite.
[matt]: Especially if you use Rao's sauce.
[matt]: I know.
[matt]: Exactly.
[matt]: Well, that's.
[matt]: That was.
[matt]: That was a test.
[matt]: I'll find out.
[matt]: Sometimes I veer off and think the carmines is going to be as good.
[matt]: It's not.
[matt]: Okay.
[matt]: Anyway, so a year ago I would try to stick to the most simple.
[matt]: Can I talk about how stainless steel was the gateway?
[matt]: Yeah, yeah.
[matt]: Is that allowed?
[matt]: Yeah, absolutely.
[matt]: We've always been against toxic pans and I never would buy the ceramic ones or any of the other brands that were saying they were non toxic because it still feel.
[matt]: Excuse me, Redo.
[matt]: We were already using non toxic pans and I would never buy the ceramic coated ones, even though it seemed like the easiest way to get non stick stick.
[matt]: And I wouldn't use any of the other future polymers that were on there.
[matt]: And I stayed away from all the gimmicky pans.
[matt]: But I eventually got some really nice stainless steel pans and I really perfected the preheat, the oil or whatever and cooking.
[matt]: So I was already getting more comfortable with cooking because of stainless steel.
[matt]: But stainless steel doesn't make you feel like you're.
[matt]: You're not bringing it with you camping.
[matt]: You're not.
[matt]: It's probably not going to last your whole life because you're going to make it gnarly.
[matt]: It just wasn't the same type of experience by knowing that everything I cooked on a cast iron was going to be a part of its journey or I could reset it at any time.
[matt]: So I already started getting into cooking because of stainless steel and I was getting more comfortable with non stick that way.
[matt]: And no, I.
[matt]: After Teflon was banned from this house, I never tried any other surface because I knew they were all going to be scratched.
[matt]: And then you're going to get to the material that you don't want in your food.
[matt]: So I had to figure out how to make stainless steel work for me.
[matt]: And that's when that vintage cast iron came in and I still didn't really know what I was trying to accomplish.
[matt]: And I had made it usable because it was from a flea market and it was an old Griswold, and I made it usable, and I started experimenting with it.
[matt]: And you treat it almost the same as you want your nonstick stainless steel to be.
[matt]: So it's not that different, but it just opened up so many more possibilities because I got griddles.
[matt]: I got, you know, different pans, and I was able to make anything in these skillets.
[matt]: Stainless steel.
[matt]: I wouldn't sear my steak.
[matt]: I wouldn't bring it camping.
[matt]: I got a lot of benefits out of it.
[matt]: What?
[matt]: So it made me want to cook more.
[matt]: And because it made me want to cook more, I started getting a lot more into it and a lot more comfortable.
[matt]: I make scrambled eggs every morning.
[matt]: I've gotten really good at them.
[matt]: You want them fluffy?
[matt]: I can do anything.
[matt]: I can flip fried eggs in the air.
[matt]: I'd never tried that.
[matt]: I'd never had it so nonstick that I could just, like, flip them in the air.
[matt]: I make pancakes on my griddle.
[matt]: All of this just started happening, especially when I got a kid, because I wanted to have her know that her dad makes all this food, too, and not just moms.
[matt]: And I was cooking some stuff, but I just.
[matt]: It unlocked me being really comfortable.
[matt]: And we do go car camping, and we do use the grill in the backyard.
[matt]: And I would just now use cast iron for anything.
[matt]: I made burgers all summer.
[matt]: I would make our shishito peppers on the grill.
[matt]: I just kind of made it, so.
[matt]: So I brought it anywhere I could.
[matt]: And when we go car camping, I would bring my Coleman stove.
[matt]: I know you still use your hands, even if it's audio.
[matt]: No.
[katie]: I was laughing at the fact that you keep qualifying camping as if you're ashamed that you're not.
[matt]: Well, I don't want Jody or any Ultra, you know, like, I'm just kidding.
[matt]: Well, I went camping, and it's intense.
[matt]: Thank you.
[matt]: But anyway, it was more of.
[matt]: And now it's really meaningful to have my daughter, who is three, only know the version of someone who, like, literally can just, like, make food at any time and feel confident and make cool meals that we all like eating and not being intimidated by the tool that you're using, because I can use it for everything, and the cleanup is fast, and I just use it every morning and every night.
[matt]: I sleep with it, and I often sleep with it when I was a kid.
[matt]: I'm not gonna tell that story.
[matt]: Thanks.
[matt]: Cut.
[matt]: I don't know how to do it when I'm like, if I was selling the pan to someone, like, I wish you could have seen my friend Andy, who stayed one night on his.
[matt]: He was on tour.
[matt]: No, but it was, like, on tour, and.
[matt]: But I would have to talk about, like, price issues.
