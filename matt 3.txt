=== TRANSCRIPT ===

[matt]: They were epic Shishitos.
[katie]: Your shishitos were great.
[matt]: Okay, now you can look.
[matt]: You didn't like my shishitos.
[matt]: Test, test, test.
[matt]: You didn't like my shishitos and you were mean.
[matt]: No, I know, but just I want everyone to know that I'm waiting for it.
[katie]: Okay, So a year ago you ate.
[matt]: A year ago my wife was the one who cooked and I would make a few meals.
[matt]: But when I cook, it's meat sauce and spaghetti, which is once a week.
[matt]: We still have that.
[matt]: It's the best.
[matt]: It's one of my favorite.
[matt]: Especially if you use Rao's sauce.
[matt]: I know.
[matt]: Exactly.
[matt]: Well, that's.
[matt]: That was.
[matt]: That was a test.
[matt]: I'll find out.
[matt]: Sometimes I veer off and think the carmines is going to be as good.
[matt]: It's not.
[matt]: Okay.
[matt]: Anyway, so a year ago I would try to stick to the most simple.
[matt]: Can I talk about how stainless steel was the gateway?
[matt]: Yeah, yeah.
[matt]: Is that allowed?
[matt]: Yeah, absolutely.
[matt]: We've always been against toxic pans and I never would buy the ceramic ones or any of the other brands that were saying they were non toxic because it still feel.
[matt]: Excuse me, Redo.
[matt]: We were already using non toxic pans and I would never buy the ceramic coated ones, even though it seemed like the easiest way to get non stick stick.
[matt]: And I wouldn't use any of the other future polymers that were on there.
[matt]: And I stayed away from all the gimmicky pans.
[matt]: But I eventually got some really nice stainless steel pans and I really perfected the preheat, the oil or whatever and cooking.
[matt]: So I was already getting more comfortable with cooking because of stainless steel.
[matt]: But stainless steel doesn't make you feel like you're.
[matt]: You're not bringing it with you camping.
[matt]: You're not.
[matt]: It's probably not going to last your whole life because you're going to make it gnarly.
[matt]: It just wasn't the same type of experience by knowing that everything I cooked on a cast iron was going to be a part of its journey or I could reset it at any time.
[matt]: So I already started getting into cooking because of stainless steel and I was getting more comfortable with non stick that way.
[matt]: And no, I.
[matt]: After Teflon was banned from this house, I never tried any other surface because I knew they were all going to be scratched.
[matt]: And then you're going to get to the material that you don't want in your food.
[matt]: So I had to figure out how to make stainless steel work for me.
[matt]: And that's when that vintage cast iron came in and I still didn't really know what I was trying to accomplish.
[matt]: And I had made it usable because it was from a flea market and it was an old Griswold, and I made it usable, and I started experimenting with it.
[matt]: And you treat it almost the same as you want your nonstick stainless steel to be.
[matt]: So it's not that different, but it just opened up so many more possibilities because I got griddles.
[matt]: I got, you know, different pans, and I was able to make anything in these skillets.
[matt]: Stainless steel.
[matt]: I wouldn't sear my steak.
[matt]: I wouldn't bring it camping.
[matt]: I got a lot of benefits out of it.
[matt]: What?
[matt]: So it made me want to cook more.
[matt]: And because it made me want to cook more, I started getting a lot more into it and a lot more comfortable.
[matt]: I make scrambled eggs every morning.
[matt]: I've gotten really good at them.
[matt]: You want them fluffy?
[matt]: I can do anything.
[matt]: I can flip fried eggs in the air.
[matt]: I'd never tried that.
[matt]: I'd never had it so nonstick that I could just, like, flip them in the air.
[matt]: I make pancakes on my griddle.
[matt]: All of this just started happening, especially when I got a kid, because I wanted to have her know that her dad makes all this food, too, and not just moms.
[matt]: And I was cooking some stuff, but I just.
[matt]: It unlocked me being really comfortable.
[matt]: And we do go car camping, and we do use the grill in the backyard.
[matt]: And I would just now use cast iron for anything.
[matt]: I made burgers all summer.
[matt]: I would make our shishito peppers on the grill.
[matt]: I just kind of made it, so.
[matt]: So I brought it anywhere I could.
[matt]: And when we go car camping, I would bring my Coleman stove.
[matt]: I know you still use your hands, even if it's audio.
[matt]: No.
[katie]: I was laughing at the fact that you keep qualifying camping as if you're ashamed that you're not.
[matt]: Well, I don't want Jody or any Ultra, you know, like, I'm just kidding.
[matt]: Well, I went camping, and it's intense.
[matt]: Thank you.
[matt]: But anyway, it was more of.
[matt]: And now it's really meaningful to have my daughter, who is three, only know the version of someone who, like, literally can just, like, make food at any time and feel confident and make cool meals that we all like eating and not being intimidated by the tool that you're using, because I can use it for everything, and the cleanup is fast, and I just use it every morning and every night.
[matt]: I sleep with it, and I often sleep with it when I was a kid.
[matt]: I'm not gonna tell that story.
[matt]: Thanks.
[matt]: Cut.
[matt]: I don't know how to do it when I'm like, if I was selling the pan to someone, like, I wish you could have seen my friend Andy, who stayed one night on his.
[matt]: He was on tour.
[matt]: No, but it was, like, on tour, and.
[matt]: But I would have to talk about, like, price issues.
