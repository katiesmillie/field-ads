SCRIPT_1
============================================================

Clip 1:
I had had other skillets like Lodge, cheaper, and I never felt connected to it enough to try to figure it out as much as I did with Field, because it felt so beautiful and smooth.

Clip 2:
And so I think something about that inspired me.

Clip 3:
I started making scrambled eggs in it. And it was easy and they were nonstick, and it started to give me more and more confidence.

Clip 4:
I make a fried egg almost every day now. And with the smaller field skillets, you can literally crack an egg or two in some of them, and it keeps a perfect shape of a fried egg and you're done.

Clip 5:
Cast iron has changed my life. I'm a better dad.
