============================================================

Clip 1:
I have so much pride in figuring this thing out. That wasn't actually that hard. I just thought it was going to be.

Clip 2:
I think the start of cooking with cast iron was always scrambled eggs. It seems like that seems to be the test of what non stick means to someone.

Clip 3:
And I think once you figure out that you can get a nonstick surface from cast iron, then you're not, you know, worried.

Clip 4:
So I think those gateways led me to cast iron chicken in the oven. It led me to sauteing mushrooms and vegetables.

Clip 5:
I literally never used three pans at once, or even two. And just the connection to it made me start getting more creative.

Clip 6:
It really does make you have some behavioral change.
